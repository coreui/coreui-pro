## CoreUI vs Bootstrap

While this {{ .Get "component" }} component is fully compatible with Bootstrap and follows its core principles, CoreUI delivers a more complete solution for modern app development.

**What sets CoreUI apart from Bootstrap?**

- ✅ **Fully compatible with Bootstrap** – Built directly on Bootstrap, all classes and behaviors work as expected.
- 🧠 **Framework-native versions** – CoreUI provides dedicated libraries for [React.js](https://coreui.io/react/), [Vue.js](https://coreui.io/vue/), and [Angular](https://coreui.io/angular/), unlike Bootstrap which relies on third-party plugins for JavaScript frameworks.
- 👨‍💻 **Maintained by a full-time team** – CoreUI is developed as a professional product, not a volunteer-driven project.
- 📦 **More built-in components** – Includes additional ready-to-use components like range sliders, multi-selects, steppers, etc.
- 🛠️ **Sass Modules support today** – CoreUI already supports Sass Modules, which are planned for Bootstrap 6.
- 🌍 **Better LTR/RTL support** – Uses modern CSS logical properties for seamless bidirectional layout support.
- 🔒 **Free LTS (Long-Term Support)** – Bootstrap now offers LTS only via paid third parties like HeroDevs, while CoreUI continues to offer long-term support natively and for free.
