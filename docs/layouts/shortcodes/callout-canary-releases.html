    <strong>Canary Releases</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    CoreUI provides canary releases, enabling you to test new, unreleased features as soon as our team determines that the latest version is ready to ship; however, we want to conduct additional tests before the final release.
  </p>
    Canary versions provide early access to upcoming changes, enabling developers to experiment with new functionalities before they are officially released. This is a great way to provide feedback to maintainers and ensure that the latest improvements work as expected.
