## Individual or compiled

Plugins can be included individually (using CoreUI's individual `js/dist/*.js`), or all at once using `coreui.js` or the minified `coreui.min.js` (don't include both).

If you use a bundler (Webpack, Rollup...), you can use `/js/dist/*.js` files which are UMD ready.

## Usage with JavaScript frameworks

## Using CoreUI for Bootstrap as a module

We provide a version of CoreUI for Bootstrap built as `ESM` (`coreui.esm.js` and `coreui.esm.min.js`) which allows you to use CoreUI for Bootstrap as a module in your browser, if your [targeted browsers support it](https://caniuse.com/es6-module).

<!-- eslint-skip -->
```html
<script type="module">
  import { Toast } from 'coreui.esm.min.js'

  Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.toast'))
    .forEach(toastNode => new Toast(toastNode))
</script>
```

Compared to JS bundlers, using ESM in the browser requires you to use the full path and filename instead of the module name. [Read more about JS modules in the browser.](https://v8.dev/features/modules#specifiers) That's why we use `'coreui.esm.min.js'` instead of `'coreui'` above. However, this is further complicated by our Popper dependency, which imports Popper into our JavaScript like so:

<!-- eslint-skip -->
```js
import * as Popper from "@popperjs/core"
```

If you try this as-is, you'll see an error in the console like the following:

```text
Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier "@popperjs/core". Relative references must start with either "/", "./", or "../".
```

To fix this, you can use an `importmap` to resolve the arbitrary module names to complete paths. If your [targeted browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=importmap) do not support `importmap`, you'll need to use the [es-module-shims](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims) project. Here's how it works for Bootstrap and Popper:

<!-- eslint-skip -->
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link href="{{< param "cdn.css" >}}" rel="stylesheet" integrity="{{< param "cdn.css_hash" >}}" crossorigin="anonymous">
    <title>Hello, modularity!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, modularity!</h1>
    <button id="popoverButton" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" data-coreui-toggle="popover" title="ESM in Browser" data-coreui-content="Bang!">Custom popover</button>

    <script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es-module-shims@1/dist/es-module-shims.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script type="importmap">
    {
      "imports": {
        "@popperjs/core": "{{< param "cdn.popper_esm" >}}",
        "coreui": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/coreui@{{< param "current_version" >}}/dist/js/coreui.esm.min.js"
      }
    }
    </script>
    <script type="module">
      import * as coreui from '@coreui/coreui'

      new coreui.Popover(document.getElementById('popoverButton'))
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Dependencies

Some plugins and CSS components depend on other plugins. If you include plugins individually, make sure to check for these dependencies in the docs.

Our dropdowns, popovers and tooltips also depend on [Popper](https://popper.js.org/).

## Data attributes

Nearly all CoreUI for Bootstrap plugins can be enabled and configured through HTML alone with data attributes (our preferred way of using JavaScript functionality). Be sure to **only use one set of data attributes on a single element** (e.g., you cannot trigger a tooltip and modal from the same button.)

## Selectors

Currently to query DOM elements we use the native methods `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` for performance reasons, so you have to use [valid selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier).
If you use special selectors, for example: `collapse:Example` be sure to escape them.

## Events

CoreUI for Bootstrap provides custom events for most plugins' unique actions. Generally, these come in an infinitive and past participle form - where the infinitive (ex. `show`) is triggered at the start of an event, and its past participle form (ex. `shown`) is triggered on the completion of an action.

All infinitive events provide [`preventDefault()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) functionality. This provides the ability to stop the execution of an action before it starts. Returning false from an event handler will also automatically call `preventDefault()`.

<!-- eslint-skip -->
```js
const myModal = document.getElementById('myModal')

myModal.addEventListener('show.coreui.modal', event => {
  return event.preventDefault() // stops modal from being shown
})
```

## Programmatic API

All constructors accept an optional options object or nothing (which initiates a plugin with its default behavior):

```js
const myModalEl = document.querySelector('#myModal')
const modal = new coreui.Modal(myModalEl) // initialized with defaults

const configObject = { keyboard: false }
const modal1 = new coreui.Modal(myModalEl, configObject) // initialized with no keyboard
```

If you'd like to get a particular plugin instance, each plugin exposes a `getInstance` method. For example, to retrieve an instance directly from an element:

```js
coreui.Popover.getInstance(myPopoverEl)
```

This method will return `null` if an instance is not initiated over the requested element.

Alternatively, `getOrCreateInstance` can be used to get the instance associated with a DOM element, or create a new one in case it wasn't initialized.

```js
coreui.Popover.getOrCreateInstance(myPopoverEl, configObject)
```

In case an instance wasn't initialized, it may accept and use an optional configuration object as second argument.

### CSS selectors in constructors

In addition to the `getInstance` and `getOrCreateInstance` methods, all plugin constructors can accept a DOM element or a valid [CSS selector](#selectors) as the first argument. Plugin elements are found with the `querySelector` method since our plugins only support a single element.

```js
const modal = new coreui.Modal('#myModal')
const dropdown = new coreui.Dropdown('[data-coreui-toggle="dropdown"]')
const offcanvas = coreui.Offcanvas.getInstance('#myOffcanvas')
const alert = coreui.Alert.getOrCreateInstance('#myAlert')
```

### Asynchronous functions and transitions

All programmatic API methods are **asynchronous** and return to the caller once the transition is started but **before it ends**.

In order to execute an action once the transition is complete, you can listen to the corresponding event.

```js
const myCollapseEl = document.getElementById('myCollapse')

myCollapseEl.addEventListener('shown.coreui.collapse', event => {
  // Action to execute once the collapsible area is expanded
})
```

In addition a method call on a **transitioning component will be ignored**.

```js
const myCarouselEl = document.getElementById('myCarousel')
const carousel = coreui.Carousel.getInstance(myCarouselEl) // Retrieve a Carousel instance

myCarouselEl.addEventListener('slid.coreui.carousel', event => {
  carousel.to('2') // Will slide to the slide 2 as soon as the transition to slide 1 is finished
})

carousel.to('1') // Will start sliding to the slide 1 and returns to the caller
carousel.to('2') // !! Will be ignored, as the transition to the slide 1 is not finished !!
```


#### `dispose` method

While it may seem correct to use the `dispose` method immediately after `hide()`, it will lead to incorrect results. Here's an example of the problem use:

```js
const myModal = document.querySelector('#myModal')
myModal.hide() // it is asynchronous

myModal.addEventListener('shown.coreui.hidden', event => {
  myModal.dispose()
})
```

### Default settings

You can change the default settings for a plugin by modifying the plugin's `Constructor.Default` object:

```js
// changes default for the modal plugin's `keyboard` option to false
coreui.Modal.Default.keyboard = false
```

## Methods and properties

Every CoreUI for Bootstrap plugin exposes the following methods and static properties.

{{< bs-table "table" >}}
| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dispose` | Destroys an element's modal. (Removes stored data on the DOM element) |
| `getInstance` | *Static* method which allows you to get the modal instance associated with a DOM element. |
| `getOrCreateInstance` | *Static* method which allows you to get the modal instance associated with a DOM element, or create a new one in case it wasn't initialized. |
{{< /bs-table >}}

{{< bs-table "table" >}}
| Static property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NAME` | Returns the plugin name. (Example: `coreui.Tooltip.NAME`) |
| `VERSION` | The version of each of CoreUI for Bootstrap's plugins can be accessed via the `VERSION` property of the plugin's constructor (Example: `coreui.Tooltip.VERSION`) |
{{< /bs-table >}}

## Sanitizer

Tooltips, Popovers, and Ratings use our built-in sanitizer to sanitize options which accept HTML.

The default `allowList` value is the following:

{{< js-docs name="allow-list" file="js/src/util/sanitizer.js" >}}

The default `svgAllowList` value for Ratings is:

{{< js-docs name="svg-allow-list" file="js/src/rating.js" >}}

If you want to add new values to this default `allowList` you can do the following:

```js
const myDefaultAllowList = coreui.Tooltip.Default.allowList

// To allow table elements
myDefaultAllowList.table = []

// To allow td elements and data-coreui-option attributes on td elements
myDefaultAllowList.td = ['data-coreui-option']

// You can push your custom regex to validate your attributes.
// Be careful about your regular expressions being too lax
const myCustomRegex = /^data-my-app-[\w-]+/
myDefaultAllowList['*'].push(myCustomRegex)
```

If you want to bypass our sanitizer because you prefer to use a dedicated library, for example [DOMPurify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify), you should do the following:

```js
const yourTooltipEl = document.querySelector('#yourTooltip')
const tooltip = new coreui.Tooltip(yourTooltipEl, {
  sanitizeFn(content) {
    return DOMPurify.sanitize(content)
  }
})
```

## Optionally using jQuery

**You don't need jQuery in CoreUI for Bootstrap**, but it's still possible to use our components with jQuery. If CoreUI for Bootstrap detects `jQuery` in the `window` object, it'll add all of our components in jQuery's plugin system. This allows you to do the following:

```js
// to enable tooltips with the default configuration
$('[data-coreui-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip()

// to initialize tooltips with given configuration
$('[data-coreui-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip({
  boundary: 'clippingParents',
  customClass: 'myClass'
})

// to trigger the `show` method
$('#myTooltip').tooltip('show')
```

The same goes for our other components.

### No conflict

Sometimes it is necessary to use CoreUI for Bootstrap plugins with other UI frameworks. In these circumstances, namespace collisions can occasionally occur. If this happens, you may call `.noConflict` on the plugin you wish to revert the value of.

```js
const coreuiButton = $.fn.button.noConflict() // return $.fn.button to previously assigned value
$.fn.coreuiBtn = coreuiButton // give $().coreuiBtn the CoreUI for Bootstrap functionality
```

CoreUI for Bootstrap does not officially support third-party JavaScript libraries like Prototype or jQuery UI. Despite `.noConflict` and namespaced events, there may be compatibility problems that you need to fix on your own.

### jQuery events

CoreUI for Bootstrap will detect jQuery if `jQuery` is present in the `window` object and there is no `data-coreui-no-jquery` attribute set on `<body>`. If jQuery is found, CoreUI for Bootstrap will emit events thanks to jQuery's event system. So if you want to listen to CoreUI for Bootstrap's events, you'll have to use the jQuery methods (`.on`, `.one`) instead of `addEventListener`.

```js
$('#myTab a').on('shown.coreui.tab', () => {
  // do something...
})
```

## Disabled JavaScript

CoreUI for Bootstrap's plugins have no special fallback when JavaScript is disabled. If you care about the user experience in this case, use [`<noscript>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/noscript) to explain the situation (and how to re-enable JavaScript) to your users, and/or add your own custom fallbacks.
