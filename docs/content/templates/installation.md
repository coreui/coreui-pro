## Tooling setup

CoreUI Bootstrap Admin Templates uses [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts/) for its build system. Our [package.json]({{< param repo >}}/blob/v{{< param current_version >}}/package.json) includes convenient methods for working with the framework, including compiling code, running tests, and more.

To use our build system and run our admin template locally, you'll need a copy of source files and Node. Follow these steps and you should be ready to rock:

1. [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which we use to manage our dependencies.
2. [Download CoreUI Admin Template]({{< docsref "/templates/download" >}}) or [Download CoreUI PRO Admin Template](https://coreui.io/download/).
3. Navigate to the root template directory and run `npm install` to install our local dependencies listed in `package.json`.

When completed, you'll be able to run the various commands provided from the command line.

## Using npm scripts

Our `package.json` includes numerous tasks for developing the project. Run `npm run` to see all the npm scripts in your terminal. **Primary tasks include:**

{{< bs-table >}}
| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start` | Compiles CSS and JavaScript, builds the documentation, and starts a local server. |
| `npm run build` | Creates the `dist/` directory with compiled files. Uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), and [terser](https://github.com/terser/terser). |
| `npm test` | Runs tests locally after running `npm run dist` |

## Sass

CoreUI uses [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) for compiling our Sass source files into CSS files (included in our build process), and we recommend you do the same if you're compiling Sass using your own asset pipeline.

Dart Sass uses a rounding precision of 10 and for efficiency reasons does not allow adjustment of this value. We don't lower this precision during further processing of our generated CSS, such as during minification, but if you chose to do so we recommend maintaining a precision of at least 6 to prevent issues with browser rounding.

## Autoprefixer

We uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) (included in our build process) to automatically add vendor prefixes to some CSS properties at build time. Doing so saves us time and code by allowing us to write key parts of our CSS a single time while eliminating the need for vendor mixins like those found in v3.

We maintain the list of browsers supported through Autoprefixer in a separate file within our GitHub repository. See `.browserslistrc`.

## Local template

Here's how to get it started:

1. Run through the [tooling setup](#tooling-setup) above to install all dependencies.
2. From the root template directory, run `npm run start` in the command line.
3. Open `http://localhost:9001/` in your browser, and voil√†.

## Troubleshooting

Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies, uninstall all previous dependency versions (global and local). Then, rerun `npm install`.
